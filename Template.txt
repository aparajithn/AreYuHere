Comments regarding your or your partner's contribution to the project (if any):

Comments:We made a viewmodel for our app and created dummy users for a teacher and a student. We then added the logic to navigate through sign in to the respective homes and the checkin/checkout(student) or generate code(teacher). We also fixed minor bugs with UI/constraints.
